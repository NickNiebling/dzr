    <name>In The Zone 2 #1</name>
    <description>Zone 2 training is one of the most important aspects of any training plan. We do not always get faster by training faster.

In Zone 2 training we are stimulating your type I muscle fibers - slow twitch.

Spending time in Zone 2 is absolutely essential to improving performance. This workout is a mashup of shorter zone 2 workouts (Zone 2 Â£#1, Cadence Pyramid &amp; Aerobic Threshold Development) to get a long and varied zone 2 workout.</description>
